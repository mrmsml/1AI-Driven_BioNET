1 RASI AI-Driven BioNET: AI-Driven Knowledge Graph for Space Bioscience Risk Analysis ðŸš€
The BioNET Explorer is a dynamic dashboard leveraging a Knowledge Graph and AI summarization to make decades of complex NASA bioscience data immediately actionable for mission planning. We developed a user-friendly web interface powered by Cytoscape.js that visualizes relationships between three key entities extracted from publications: Phenotypes (Risks), Organisms, and Biological Categories.

The project directly addresses the challenge by tackling data discoverability. Instead of manually sifting through papers, users can instantly see the system-wide impact of space stressors. Crucially, we implemented centrality mapping, visually scaling the size of a risk (Phenotype node) based on the number of organisms it affects, providing an immediate, visual risk summary. For scientific rigor, the tables are linked directly to source publications.

BioNET is important because it converts massive, siloed research data into an intuitive, interactive risk assessment tool. By reducing complexity and highlighting cross-organism findings, it accelerates the identification of critical biological risks, directly enabling safer and more informed human exploration of the Moon and Mars.
